			SINGLETON: 

			Singleton is a creational design pattern that ensures 
			a class has one, only one, instance, while providing a global 
			access point to that instance. 

			Use the Singleton pattern when a class in your program 
			should have just a single instance available to all clients; 
			for example, a single database object shared by different 
			parts of the program.

			Use the Singleton pattern when you need stricter control over 
			global variables.
