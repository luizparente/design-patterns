			This is a reimplementation of the Factory design pattern,
			but using generics for maximized reusability.

			As with all Factory patterns, this one is useful when
			strict control is needed as to how classes are instantiated.

			This may seem a little more complicated, but it is just
			a more generic approach. This strategy is recommended when
			many different factories will be needed in the project.
