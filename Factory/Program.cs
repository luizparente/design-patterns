			FACTORY:
			
			Factory Method is a creational design pattern 
			that provides an interface for creating instances
			of a class.

			There are many examples online that implement this
			pattern by defining the Create method with a parameter
			that defines a subtype to return. In my opinion, this
			implementation style breaks the Open-Closed Principle. 
			Any extensions to Create would necessarily require a 
			new if-else statement for the newly added type.

			There are different factory strategies that circumvent
			this issue, and they are also included in this project.

			Use the Factory Pattern when you need strict
			control on how instances of a class are created.
